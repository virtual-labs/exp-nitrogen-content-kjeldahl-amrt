### Procedure

#### Apparatus:
 
Kjeldahl Digestion Assembly, Ammonia Distillation Assembly.


  <h2>Determination of Available Nitrogen Content in Soil</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Weigh <strong>50 g</strong> of processed soil sample in a 500 mL Kjeldahl flask.</li>
    <li>Add <strong>1 g CuSO₄</strong>, <strong>10 g K₂SO₄</strong>, and <strong>30 mL concentrated H₂SO₄</strong>.</li>
    <li>Shake the contents thoroughly and allow to stand for 30 minutes with intermittent shaking until complete solution forms.</li>
    <li>Digest until a greenish color appears. K₂SO₄ raises the boiling point of H₂SO₄ to prevent loss. CuSO₄•5H₂O catalyzes digestion.</li>
    <li>Run a blank with reagents only and subtract its value from the sample result.</li>
    <li>Digest on Kjeldahl rack: low flame (10–30 mins) until frothing stops, then raise heat until sample is charred and acid reaches 1/3 of the flask height. Avoid overheating above the liquid level.</li>
    <li>Cool and dilute to ~100 mL with distilled water. Swirl for 2 mins, transfer fluid to a 1000 mL distillation flask.</li>
    <li>Wash residue 4–5 times with 50–60 mL distilled water. Decant into the distillation flask.</li>
    <li>Add glass beads to prevent bumping.</li>
    <li>Set up distillation with a dropping funnel (for 40% NaOH), a Kjeldahl trap, and a condenser tube into <strong>50 mL 0.1N HCl</strong> with methyl red indicator.</li>
    <li>Add <strong>125 mL (or 100 mL if bumping occurs)</strong> of 40% NaOH until contents are alkaline (approx. 5× H₂SO₄ used). Heat the flask.</li>
    <li>Allow NH₃ to be absorbed in the standard HCl. Wash the end of the delivery tube. Add <strong>150 mL distilled water</strong> to the conical flask. Stop distillation once no NH₃ is detected (red litmus stays red).</li>
    <li>Titrate excess HCl with 0.1 N NaOH until methyl red changes from pink to yellow.</li>
    <li>Calculate the amount of nitrogen from titration results.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>a) Calculation:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Blank:</strong><br>
      Volume of HCl = <em>a</em> mL<br>
      Volume of NaOH = <em>b</em> mL<br>
      HCl consumed = <em>z = a – b</em> mL
    </li>
    <li><strong>Sample:</strong><br>
      Volume of HCl = <em>v</em> mL<br>
      Volume of NaOH = <em>u</em> mL<br>
      HCl consumed = <em>w = v – u</em> mL<br>
      HCl for sample = <em>y = w – z</em> mL
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Conversions:</strong><br>
    1000 mL 1N HCl = 17 g NH₃ = 14 g N<br>
    1 mL 1N HCl = 0.014 g N<br>
    1 mL 0.1N HCl = 0.0014 g N<br>
    Nitrogen in 5 g sample = <strong>q = y × 0.0014</strong> g N
  </p>

  <p><strong>% Nitrogen in Sample:</strong><br>
    <code>(q × 100) / 5</code>
  </p>

  <h3>Points to Remember While Performing the Experiment:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Always wear a lab coat and gloves.</li>
    <li>Switch on the exhaust fan and check availability of chemicals.</li>
    <li>Adjust the Bunsen burner flame to a small blue cone.</li>
    <li>Clean apparatus with chromic acid and distilled water. Ensure they are dry.</li>
    <li>Calibrate the electronic balance before use.</li>
    <li>Ensure desiccator contains silica gel.</li>
    <li>Clean the crucible with chromic acid, heat, and cool before placing in the desiccator. Use tongs or tissue only—never hands.</li>
    <li>Set oven temperature to 130°C. Use cotton gloves when handling hot items.</li>
    <li>Ensure Kipp’s apparatus is clean and contains iron sulfide and H₂SO₄.</li>
    <li>Recap reagent bottles after use. Turn off the fan, light, gas, and oven before leaving.</li>
    <li>Discard used gloves in the waste bin.</li>
  </ul>
