      "question": "The process by which organic nitrogen is converted to nitrate through bacterial activity is known as?",

        "a": "Aminization",
        "b": "Immobilisation",
        "c": "Denitrification",
        "d": "Nitrification"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Conversion to amines, not nitrate.",
        "b": "Immobilization retains N in organic form.",
        "c": "Denitrification is the reduction of nitrate.",
        "d": "Correct. Nitrification converts NH4+ to NO3‚Åª."

      "question": "In which condition does denitrification occur?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Oxygen and nitrogen limiting condition",
        "b": "Oxygen excess condition",
        "c": "Oxygen limiting condition",
        "d": "Nitrogen limiting condition"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Partially correct, but not necessary to be N-limited.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Denitrification is anaerobic.",
        "c": "Correct. Denitrification occurs under low oxygen.",
        "d": "Nitrogen must be available to be reduced."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Partial process producing amines.",
        "b": "Opposite process (organic N retention).",
